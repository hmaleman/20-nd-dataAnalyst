# Data Analyst Nanodegree

## 1. Syllabus
### 1.0 Analyze Bay Area Bike Data
> You’ll download Anaconda and use a Jupyter Notebook to analyze bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!
- Estimated time: 3h
- Project: p0 Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data [link](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/December/584f2948_dandp0-bikeshareanalysis/dandp0-bikeshareanalysis.zip)

### 1.1 Test a Perceptual Phenomenom
> Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. 
- Estimated time: 56,5h
- Content: [Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)
- Project: p1 Test a Perceptual Phenomenom

### 1.2 Investigate a Dataset
> Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
- Estimated time: 20h
- Content: Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks, Intro to Data Analysis
- Project: p2 Investigate a Dataset
- Elective: How to use Git and GitHub

### 1.3 Wrangle OpenStreeMap Data
> Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.
- Estimated time: 61,5h
- Content: Data wrangling, SQL for Data Analysis, Mongo DB for Data Analysis
- Project: p3 Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data - googledocs

### 1.4 Explore and Summarize Data
> Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
- Estimated time: 24,5h
- Content: Data analysis with R
- Project: p4 Explore and Summarize Data - googledocs

### 1.5 Idendify Fraud from Enron Email
> Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset
- Estimated time: 65,5h
- Content: Intro to Machine Learning
- Project: p5 Identify Fraud from Enron Email

### 1.6 Make effective Data Visualization
> Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
- Estimated time: 46,5h
- Content: Data Visualization with D3.js
- Project : p6 Make effective Data Visualization

### 1.7 Design an A/B Test
> Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
- Estimated time: 24,5h
- Content: A/B Testing
- Project: p7 Design an A/B Test
